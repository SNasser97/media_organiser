# media_uploader
### A Synoptic Project was completed at the end of my apprenticeship with QA.
A Media uploader where you can upload media files to the database and view them on the web page or delete from the page.


1. `install xampp`
2. `download the repo as a zip`
3. `place the media_uploader-master into htdocs`
4. `Create database "media" without quotes`
5. `import media.sql into the database "media" in phpmyadmin`

Additional info provided in README.txt when copying the project over.

NOTE: To view from local machine - use XAMPP
